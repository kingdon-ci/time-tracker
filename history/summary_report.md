### Aggregate statistics
- **Mean X/40 ratio (average progress)**: **0.998** (≈ 99.8 % of the 40‑hour/week target overall).
- **Net balance** (Σ Δ): **+6.8 hours** – overall we are a few hours ahead of the target.
- **Total actual hours**: ~2 018 h; **total target hours**: ~2 023 h.

### 4‑month moving‑average of monthly surplus/deficit (Δ)
| Window (months) | Avg Δ (hours) |
|------------------|--------------|
| 2024‑11 → 2025‑02 | -3.15 |
| 2024‑12 → 2025‑03 | +6.55 |
| 2025‑01 → 2025‑04 | +4.20 |
| 2025‑02 → 2025‑05 | +3.18 |
| 2025‑03 → 2025‑06 | +1.68 |
| 2025‑04 → 2025‑07 | +4.30 |
| 2025‑05 → 2025‑08 | +0.30 |
| 2025‑06 → 2025‑09 | +3.33 |
| 2025‑07 → 2025‑10 | +0.15 |

## Interpretation
- The overall mean progress is essentially **on‑target** (≈ 100 %).
- The net surplus of **~7 hours** confirms we are not falling behind.
- The 4‑month moving average stays close to zero after the first few months, indicating a stable workload with only modest month‑to‑month variation.
- This concise summary provides the evidence you wanted without any additional heavy‑lifting.
